/**
 * @file One scene item built out of several, placed and moved as a unit.
 *
 * A structure is an AutoCAD block that has already been stamped: it holds real
 * fixtures and objects at transforms relative to its own, and it has no link
 * back to the library definition it came from. Editing the definition later
 * does not reach the things already placed, which is the whole point -- the
 * alternative wants an update path nobody asked for.
 *
 * Members are held rather than referenced. They keep a `localTransform`, and
 * their absolute transform is derived from the structure's whenever it moves,
 * so everything downstream -- renderers, the gizmo, the patch -- carries on
 * seeing ordinary items standing at absolute coordinates.
 *
 * **Members are not individually movable.** That is not enforced by refusing
 * writes here: `applyToMembers` writes through the very same setters, so a
 * guard on the model would have to be bypassed by the one caller that matters.
 * It is enforced where the intent exists instead -- a 3D pick resolves a
 * member to its structure, and the position widgets go read-only when
 * `item.structure` is set. A member remains selectable in the structure's own
 * widget, because a fixture inside a truss still needs its DMX address.
 *
 * Membership is exclusive: an item belongs to one structure or to none.
